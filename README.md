# Cats vs Dogs vs Pandas Image Classification

## Overview
This project uses **PyTorch** to build an image classification model that can identify **cats, dogs, and pandas**.  
It leverages **transfer learning** with pretrained models (VGG19, ResNet18, etc.), data augmentation, and GPU acceleration when available.
